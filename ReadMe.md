# One line at a time

## How to play
This is a silly group writing game where you tell a story together, one sentence at a time, without being able to see what the other players wrote before you. When everyone has finished all of their turns, the whole story is revealed in all it's nonsensical glory.

## Current mechanics
So far, the basic game lets the user specify how many players are playing, what their names are, and how many turns everyone will get. On a player's turn, they may write anything they like (at a currently unlimited length). When done, they click a button, and it's the next player's turn. Once everyone has used their turns, the game will end and reveal the whole story.

### Changelog

**v0.1**
* Combined story array adds gaps between entries for better coherency.

**v0.11**
* Added punctuation detection to player submissions for better story readability. If a player does not end their submission with punctuation, a full stop will be automatically added.

**v0.12**
* Added the ability to save the final story as a .txt file.

**v0.13**
* Fixed bugs that caused player name inputs to act strangely. Thanks @mceachsamu!

### Future fixes, improvements, and features
* Revision of description info, button names, etc. UX considerations.
* Option to restart the game over using the same game settings, instead of going back to the very start and having to reselect them.
* Eventual redesigned version with fancy UI and even cooler features...
